# Automated Quality Assurance Report

## Call: call_CA01f28a43a42b0b05053ba0e884251e36.json
- Hallucinations: The response "With Alex" appears out of context with the question about accepting new patients, suggesting that the AI might have misprocessed or fabricated this information.
- Failure to understand user intent: The Target AI's response "With Alex" fails to directly address the patient's question about accepting new patients; it was an unrelated response.
- Awkward phrasing or latency issues: The phrase "Yes, to the point, Orthopedics is accepting new patients" seems somewhat awkward in phrasing, which might suggest latency or misunderstanding of conversational flow.

## Call: call_CA3610ee1b62a1a6cc0034ee8eba22ceca.json
- **Awkward Phrasing**: The phrase "I am I speaking with Alex." seems awkward and possibly the result of a typo or language mistake.
- **Latency Issues Implied by Context**: The sentence "Recorded for quality and training purposes. But" does not directly address the user's query, leading to a disjointed start to the conversation.
- **Failure to Understand User Intent**: Initially, the Target AI does not acknowledge the confusion about the nature of the call (pizza place inquiry) and instead proceeds with a pre-recorded message and incorrect identification question.

- Hallucinations: The phrase "debit Point Orthopedics" does not make sense in the context of the question about insurance acceptance. This appears to be a hallucination by the AI.
- Awkward phrasing: The sentence structure "Yes, debit Point Orthopedics, accepts..." is awkward and confusing, further indicating a possible processing error or misunderstanding of the context.
